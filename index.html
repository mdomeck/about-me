          <p>I have lived in Ohio my whole life. My mom still lives in the home that I was born and raised in. I have a daughter named Rylei and we enjoy going for walks, riding bikes and watching movies. When I have time I enjoy knitting, playing the cello and working on jigsaw puzzles.</p>

          <p>I graduated from Kent State University with a BS in Family Studies. I then started my career with Bright Horizons. I have worked the last 19 years as a teacher, Director and substitute staffing supervisor. My most recent role allowed me to work from home but was impacted by covid 19. I'm now pursing new opportunities and my goal is to further develop my coding skills and move ahead as a software developer.</p>
